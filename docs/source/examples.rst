There are also examples associated with published documentation. The documentation
is written for the version of Biogeme at the time of publication. The online examples are updated for the latest
version.

Calculating indicators
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
After the parameters of a model have been estimated, the model can be used to derive various indicators, such as
market shares, or elasticities, that are used by policy makers.
This is explained in details in `Bierlaire (2018a) <https://transp-or.epfl.ch/documents/technicalReports/Bier18a.pdf>`_

Monte-Carlo integration
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It is possible to calculate complex integrals using Monte-Carlo integration in Biogeme. This is explained in details
in `Bierlaire (2019) <http://transp-or.epfl.ch/documents/technicalReports/Bier19.pdf>`_

Choice models with latent variables
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Hybrid choice models, that is, choice models involving latent variables, can be estimated with Biogeme. This is
explained in details in `Bierlaire (2018b) <https://transp-or.epfl.ch/documents/technicalReports/Bier18b.pdf>`_

Assisted specification algorithm
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An assisted specification algorithm is available in Biogeme. Its usage is detailed in
`Bierlaire and Ortelli (2023) <https://transp-or.epfl.ch/documents/technicalReports/BierOrte23.pdf>`_

Estimation with samples of alternatives
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It is possible to estimate choice models using only a sample of alternatives. The implementation is still experimental,
and continues to be test. It is described in `Bierlaire and Paschalidis (2023) <https://transp-or.epfl.ch/documents/technicalReports/BierPasc23.pdf>`_

Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value models
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It is possible to estimate the parameters of Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) models with Biogeme,
and to use the estimated model for forecasting. This is described in n upcoming report.
