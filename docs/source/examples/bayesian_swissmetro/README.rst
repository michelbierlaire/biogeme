Biogeme examples for Bayesian inference with the Swissmetro data
****************************************************************

You find here several examples of models that illustrate how to specify models to be estimated with Biogeme using
Bayesian inference. To the extent possible, we have used the same examples illustrating the maximum
likelihood estimation. The names of the files should correspond too.
