Biogeme examples for hybrid choice models
*****************************************

This directory provides example implementations of MIMIC and hybrid
choice models estimated with Biogeme, using both maximum likelihood
and Bayesian methods. The examples range from latent-variable-only
models to fully integrated hybrid choice models and are intended as
reproducible references and learning material.
