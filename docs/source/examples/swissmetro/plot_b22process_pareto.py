Re-estimate the Pareto optimal models
=====================================

The assisted specification algorithm generates a file containg the
pareto optimal specification. This script is designed to re-estimate
the Pareto optimal models. The catalog of specifications is defined in
:ref:`plot_b22multiple_models_spec` .

# corresponds to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The
# y-coordinate corresponds to the Bayesian Information Criterion
# (BIC). Note that there is a third objective that does not appear on
# this picture: the number of parameters. If the shape of the dot is a
# circle, it means that it corresponds to a Pareto optimal model. If
# the shape is a cross, it means that the model has been Pareto
# optimal at some point during the algorithm and later removed as a
# new model dominating it has been found. If the shape is a start, it
# means that the model has been deemed invalid.
