Nested logit with corrections for endogeneous sampling
======================================================

The sample is said to be endogenous if the probability for an
individual to be in the sample depends on the choice that has been
made. In that case, the ESML estimator is not appropriate anymore, and
corrections need to be made. See `Bierlaire, bolduc, McFadden (2008)
<https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2007.09.003>`_.

This is illustrated in this example.
