Install Python
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Biogeme is an open source Python package, that relies on the version 3 of Python. Make sure that Python 3.x is
installed on your computer. If you have never used Python before, you may want to consider a complete platform such as
Anaconda.

If Python is already installed on your computer, verify the version. Two versions of Python are distributed: version 2
and version 3. Biogeme works only with version 3.
