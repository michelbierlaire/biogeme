@article{SaloBenA83,
	Abstract = {The concept of life-style is becoming a major differentiating trait between population groups substituting for economic and social classes.This paper describes the utilization of the concept of life-style in the context of travel demand models. Life-style is defined as a pattern of behavior under constrained resources which conforms to the orientations an individual has toward three major `life decisions' he or she must make: (a) formation of a household (of any type), (b) participation in the labor force, and (c) orientation toward leisure.A population is classified into life-style groups based on similarity in a multivariate space. Socioeconomic and demographic variables define that space, and emphasis is put on variables which are indicative of emerging new life-styles (for example, the relative contribution of the female spouse to the household income). Cluster analysis is employed to identify the life-style groups.Models for the combinations of choice of mode and destination for shopping trips are estimated for the pooled sample and the life-style segments. Comparisons of these models with the performance of other market segmentation schemes and with the pooled model demonstrate that the life-style groups account for taste variations better than the other schemes.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a simple modification of a conventional method of moments estimator for a discrete response model, replacing response probabilities that require numerical integration with estimators obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. This method of simulated moments (MSM) does not require precise estimates of these probabilities for consistency and asymptotic normality, relying instead on the law of large numbers operating across observations to control simulation error, and hence can use simulations of practical size. The method is useful for models such as high-dimensional multinomial probit (MNP), where computation has restricted applications.},

	Abstract = { Many consumer choice situations involve the selection of optional items or features from a menu. Often, in these situations, predesigned bundles or packages of items are also offered. We present an analytical approach to these menu situations which takes into account the large number of alternatives they represent, the interrelated nature of demand for the individual items, and the impact of bundling of items. The emphasis of our data-collection approach is on providing a realistic choice setting which represents all possible alternatives. In our modelling approach, we employ discrete choice modelling techniques which explicitly capture the full range of these alternatives. We present the results of an empirical study of enhanced custom-calling features for residential telephone service. Using this approach, we developed well-behaved choice models that were used to predict demand and revenues for the features under a wide range of marketing scenarios. },

In this paper a maximum-likelihood method based on the conditional distribution given minimal sufficient statistics for the incidental parameters is suggested. It is proved that conditional maximum-likelihood estimates in the regular case are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed with a simple asymptotic variance. The efficiency problem of this new estimator is discussed in particular with respect to some situations with ancillary information.},

	Abstract = {The authors develop an approach to determine and analyze choice set restriction on the basis of secondary source information on consumer purchase histories. Individual-level choice sets are estimated using a Bayesian updating procedure in conjunction with the multinomial logit model. The authors apply the procedure to scanner panel data for the liquid laundry detergent category. An analysis of estimated choice sets across panelists reveals that market share does not "go hand-in-hand" with choice set share (the percentage of choice sets in which a brand is a member). Examining choice set membership patterns, such as the cooccurrence of brands in the same product line, also provides insight into sister-brand cannibalization. Estimation results also show that promotions can expand choice sets, providing excluded brands a means to gain entry and long-term sales benefits.},

The estimator is efficient and can incorporate information on the marginal choice probabilities in a straightforward manner and for that case leads to a procedure that is computationally and intuitively more appealing than the estimators that have been proposed before. The idea is to start with a flexible parameterization of the distribution of the explanatory variables and then rewrite the estimator to remove dependence on these parametric assumptions.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a model with polychotomous choices and selectivity and then applies it to the problem of estimating the returns to technical school training. Using the National Longitudinal Survey data set on young men the paper finds evidence of self-selectivity in the high school wage equation and estimates the wage effect of technical school to be a $1.27 per hour increase in wages. This amounts to an estimated rate of return of 9% to 11.2%, which is slightly higher than estimates obtained by others. Without correcting for selectivity bias the rate of return is underestimated by 6%.},
