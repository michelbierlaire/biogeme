	<div class="panel-heading">Why is the file headers.py not generated?</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
	  <p>In order to comply better with good programming practice in
	    Python, the syntax to import the variable names from the data
	    file has been modified since version 3.2.5. The file
	    <code>headers.py</code> is not generated anymore. The statement
	  </p>
	  <p><code>from headers import *</code></p>
	  <p>must be replaced by</p>
	  <p><code>
	      globals().update(database.variables)
	    </code>
	  </p>
	  <p>where <code>database</code>  is the object containing the
	    database, created as follows:</p>
	  <p>  <code>
	      import biogeme.database as db<br>
	      df = pd.read_csv("swissmetro.dat",'\t')<br>
	      database = db.Database("swissmetro",df)
	  </code></p>
	  <p>Moreover, in order to avoid any ambiguity, the operators used by
	    Biogeme must be explicitly imported. For instance:</p>
	  <p>
	    <code>
	      from biogeme.expressions import Beta, bioDraws, PanelLikelihoodTrajectory, MonteCarlo, log
	    </code>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Note that it is also possible to import all of them using the
	    following syntax</p>
	  <p>  <code>
	      from biogeme.expressions import *
	  </code></p>
	  <p>  although this is not a good Python programming practice. </p>

	<div class="panel-body">
	  If you have the results of a previous estimation, it may be
	  a good idea to use the estimated values as a starting point
	  for the estimation of a similar models. If not, it depends
	  on the nature of the parameters:
	  <ul>
	    <li>If the parameter is a coefficient (traditionally
	      denoted by &beta;), the value 0 is
	      appropriate.</li>
	    <li>If the parameter is a nest parameter of a nested or
	      cross-nested logit model (traditionally
	      denoted by &mu;), the value 1 is
	      appropriate. Make sure to define the lower bound of the
	      parameter to 1.</li>
	    <li>If the parameter is the nest membership coefficient of
	    a cross-nested logit model (traditionally
	      denoted by &alpha;), the value 0.5 is
	    appropriate. Make sure to define the lower bound to 0 and
	      the upper bound to 1.</li>
	    <li>If the parameter captures the membership to a class of
	    a latent class model, the value 0.5 is appropriate. Make
	      sure to define the lower bound to 0 and
	      the upper bound to 1.</li>
	    <li>If the parameter is the scale of an error component in
	      a mixture of logit model (traditionally
	      denoted by &sigma;), the value must be sufficient
	      large so that the likelihood of each observation is not
	      too close to zero. It is suggested to try first with the
	      value one. If there are numerical issues, try a larger
	      value, such as 10. See Section 7 in the report
	      "Estimating choice models  with latent variables
	      with PandasBiogeme" for a detailed discussion. </li>

      <div id="q3" class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading">Can I save intermediate iterations
	    during the estimation?</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
	  <p>
	  Yes. It is actually the default behavior. At each
	  iteration, Biogeme creates a
	  file <code>__myModel.iter</code>. This file will be read the
	  next time Biogeme tries to estimate the same model. If you want to turn this
	  feature off, set the BIOGEME class
	  variable <code>saveIterations</code> to <code>False</code>.

      <div id="q4" class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading">Does Biogeme provide support for
	    out-of-sample validation?</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
	  <p>
	    Yes.  See
	      example <code><a href="examples/swissmetro/04validation.py">04validation.py</a>
	      from <a href="examples.html#swissmetro">here</a>. </li>
	    </ul>

      <div id="q5" class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading">The init loglikelihood is <code>-1.797693e+308</code>
 and no iteration is performed. What should I do?</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
	  <p>If the model returns a probability 0 for the chosen
	  alternative for at least one observation in the sample, then
	  the likelihood is 0, and the log likelihood is minus
	  infinity. For the sake of robustness, Biogeme assigns the
	  value <code>-1.797693e+308</code> to the log likelihood in
	  this context. 
	  </p>
	  <p>A possible reason is when the initial value of a scale
	  parameter is too close to zero. See the discussion <a href="#q2">here</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>But there are many other possible reasons. The best way
	  to investigate the source of the problem is to use Biogeme
	  in simulation mode, and report the probability of the chosen
	  alternative for each observation. Once you have identified
	  the problematic entries, it is easier to investigate the
	    reason why the model returns a probability of zero.
