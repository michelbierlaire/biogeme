	    Biogeme is a open source <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> package designed for the
	    maximum likelihood estimation of parametric models
	    in general, with a special emphasis on discrete
	    choice models. It relies on the
	    package <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Python Data
	      Analysis Library called Pandas</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>Biogeme used to be a stand alone software package, written in
	    C++. All the material related to the previous versions of
	    Biogeme are available on

	<div class="panel-body">
	  <dl>
	    <dt>New syntax for <code>DefineVariable</code></dt>
	    <dd>
	      <p><code>DefineVariable</code> actually defines a new column in the
		database. The old syntax was:</p>
	      <p><code>myvar = DefineVariable('myvar', x * y + 2,
		  database)</code></p>
	      <p>The new syntax is:</p>
	      <p><code>myvar = database.DefineVariable('myvar', x * y +
		  2)</code></p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Likelihood ratio test</dt>
	    <dd>It is now possible to perform a likelihood ratio test
	    directly from the estimation results. <a href="sphinx/results.html#biogeme.results.bioResults.likelihood_ratio_test">See
		documentation here. </a> It relies on a function that can
	    be used in more general context. <a href="sphinx/tools.html#biogeme.tools.likelihood_ratio_test"> See
	    documentation here.<a></dd>
	    <dt>Comparing several models</dt>
	    <dd>It is now possible to compile the estimation results
	    from several models into a single data frame. <a href="sphinx/results.html#biogeme.results.compileEstimationResults">See
		documentation here. </a> </dd>
	    <dt>Automatic segmentation</dt>
	    <dd>It is now possible to define a parameter such that it
	    has a different value for each segment in the
	    population. See the example <a href="examples/swissmetro/01logitBis.py"><code>01logitBis.py</code></a>.</dd>
	    <dt>Simulation of panel data</dt>
	    <dd>It is now possible to use Biogeme in simulation mode
	    for panel data. See the following
	      example: <a href="examples/swissmetro/13panel_simul.py"><code>13panel_simul.py</code></a>.</dd>
	    <dt>Flattening panel data</dt>
	    <dd>This new feature transforms a database organized in
	    panel mode (that is, one row per observation) into a
	    database organized in normal mode (that is, one row per
	    individual, and the observations of each individual
	    across columns). See documentation
	    <a href="sphinx/database.html#biogeme.database.Database.generateFlatPanelDataframe">here</a> and <a href="sphinx/tools.html#biogeme.tools.flatten_database">here</a></dd>
	    <dt>Covariance and correlation matrix of the nested and
	      the cross-nested logit
	      models</dt>
	    <dd>These new functions calculate the covariance and the correlation matrix
	    of the error terms of a cross-nested logit model from the
	    estimated parameters. See
	    documentation <a href="sphinx/tools.html#biogeme.tools.calculate_correlation">here</a>,
	    <a href="sphinx/tools.html#biogeme.tools.correlation_nested">here</a>, <a href="sphinx/tools.html#biogeme.tools.covariance_cross_nested">here</a> and <a href="sphinx/tools.html#biogeme.tools.correlation_cross_nested">here</a>.</dd>
	    <dt>Recycling estimation results</dt>
	    <dd>It is now possible to skip estimation and read the
	    estimation results from the pickle file by setting the
	    parameter <code>recycle=True</code>. See the online
	    documentation [<a href="sphinx/biogeme.html#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME.estimate">here</a>].</dd>
	    <dt>The feature removing unused variables has been
	      canceled.</dt>
	    <dd>The parameters <code>removeUnusedVariables</code>
	    and <code>displayUsedVariables</code> in the BIOGEME
	      constructor have been removed.</dd>
	    <dt>More functionalities for the mathematical expressions.</dt>
	    <dd>The expressions have now been designed to also be
	    available outside of the BIOGEME class. A detailed
	    illustration of the functionalities is available
	    [<a href="https://github.com/michelbierlaire/biogeme/blob/master/examples/notebooks/biogeme.expressions.ipynb">Click
		here</a>].</dd>
	    <dt>New syntax for the assisted specification algorithm</dt>
	    <dd>The new syntax involves <code>NamedTuple</code> to make the code
	      more readable. Refer to the examples, such as
	      <a href="examples/assisted/optima.py"
		 target="_blank"><code>optima.py</code></a>.</dd>

	  <p>Several versions of Biogeme have been developed over the
	    years. Several names of animals appear: Gnu, Bison, Python, and now, Pandas. </p>
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Version -1: HieLoW</dt>
	    <dd>	 <p>   Around 1990, Michel Bierlaire wrote a software package
		called <em>HieLoW: Hierarchical Logit for
		  Windows</em>. It was written in Borland C++, and was the
		first discrete choice estimation software with a
		graphical user interface. It was designed for the
		estimation of logit and nested logit models. The user
		had to specify the models through a graphical user
		interface.  This software was distributed by Stratec SA,
		Brussels.</p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Version 1: BisonBiogeme</dt>
	    <dd><p> Around 2000, the first version of Biogeme was
		released. Written in GNU C++, it was the first open source
		discrete choice software. It was designed to estimate the
		parameters of a list of predetermined discrete choice
		models such as logit, binary probit, nested logit,
		cross-nested logit, multivariate extreme value models,
		discrete and continuous mixtures of multivariate extreme
		value models, models with nonlinear utility functions,
		models designed for panel data, and heteroscedastic
		models. The modeling language was designed to be simple,
		and was developed using a a general-purpose parser
		generator
		called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/"
			  target="_blank">GNU Bison</a>. Later, it will be referred
		to as BisonBiogeme. The
		distributions can be found <a href='archives.html'>here</a>.
	      </p>
	    </dd>
	    <dt><a href="http://transp-or.epfl.ch/pythonbiogeme/"
		   target="_blank">Version 2: PythonBiogeme</a></dt>
	    <dd><p>
		Around 2010, a more flexible version was designed for general purpose parametric models.  The  modeling language was extended, and based on
		the Python language. A series of discrete
		choice models were precoded for an easy use. Also written in GNU C++, the
		distributions can be found <a href='archives.html'>here</a>.
	    </p></dd>
	    <dt>Version 3: PandasBiogeme</dt>
	    <dd><p>In 2018, a completely new version of the software was
		released. It was not anymore a standalone executable, but a
		Python package. The package is written in Python, with the
		exception of the core calculations of the models, that are
		written in C++ for the sake of efficiency.  The motivation
		was to combine the simplicity of the usage (especially for
		teaching purposes), with the sophistication provided by
		Python (for research and applications purposes). Morever, the management of the data relies on the
		package Pandas, which has become the workhorse of data
		scientists. Therefore, the name PandasBiogeme has been
		adopted. It is distributed on the
		<a href="https://pypi.org/project/biogeme/" target="_blank">Python
		  Package Index</a> repository.
